0. Make sure keijiro code runs on individual frames in a way that's easy to plug new frames into
 - it does
0.5: get the yolov4 runnning on Andy computer
1. get video running from hololens and displaying to cube/plane
 - harder than expected. I think we can use this library (https://github.com/EnoxSoftware/HoloLensCameraStream)
 - Alternative here: https://forums.hololens.com/discussion/1032/accessing-the-raw-video-stream-in-unity-not-saving-to-a-file
2. frido - recognition on a cube
 - does it on the model, just pass a texture
2.5 get debug output to show up

2.6 get model into the camera file (loaded, not running)
2.7 get model inferenceing on static image
2.8 get model inferencing on real camera image

3.0 get markers placed down programmatically using the camerastream pixelcoords2world - they're really laggy, probably due to being placed in the user's head space
3.01 standalone button works

3.02 forgot which way to place the markers
3.1 get markers placed down where the detector sees objects - make sure the user sees them in the right place


3.2 get text placed down programmatically instead of markers

3.3 get video streaming pane removed from view of viewer

<-------------------- YOU ARE HERE



3.4 on user interaction (button or gesture), labelled object reveals more information
3.5 fix run speed of detector
